# generate-password

## Description
Given a prebuilt application, a JavaScript file needed a function to randomly create a password for any user who selected a length of characters from 8 to 128, and be displayed on the main page. The main learned lesson from this project is the importance of pseudocoding and how important JavaScript fundamentals are.

## Usage
This web application generates a random password when the user selects from 8 to 128 characters, an advantage of this web application is that the user can choose the type of characters to be randomly display (UpperCase, LowerCase, Numbers, Symbols). Once the "Generate Password" button is clicked a small window is going to be prompted, once the number of characters needed are entered by the user, after selecting the desired characters the password will be displayed.
